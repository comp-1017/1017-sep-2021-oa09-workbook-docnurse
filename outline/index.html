            <h4>Spring Yin Workshop </h4>
            <p>It happens every spring. This year’s Spring Yin Workshop will be with Tori Lunden on Saturday, May 28,
                2016 from 2:15pm - 4:15pm. After the joy and jubilation of being able to play outside comes the aches
                and pains in areas we forgot we had. It comes as a bit of a shock to our bodies this shift to suddenly
                gardening, biking, running, hiking, along with all the other outdoor activities we love. Even for those
                that stay active through the winter; the spring is often accompanied by stiff muscles and creaky joints.
            </p>
            <p> This extended practice will help our bodies through this rocky transition with a combination of gentle
                movement and passive, supported stretches for the shoulders, back, and hips. Take two hours to relax and
                restore so you can get on with enjoying our beautiful Edmonton summer. </p>
            <p>This practice is suitable for beginners, experienced students, and especially beneficial for those with
                active lifestyles. The cost will be $30 (includes GST). Please register in advance at
                http://www.shantillyyogastudio.ca/events or call 780-421-9444</p>
            <p>Tori's classes are always a fun and eclectic environment. She delights in teaching people who, like her,
                never thought yoga was something they could do let alone enjoy. Tori has a degree in social work from
                the University of Calgary and has been teaching yoga since 2008; when she would never again work
                anywhere that required her to sit for eight hours a day.</p>

            <p>The clothing swaps are a great community event! Come and chat with those faces you see in classes, but

            <h4>With so many different options, which is the best class for me?</h4>
            <p>Most of our classes are appropriate for all levels. No matter what class you take, our teachers are adept
                at modifying for each individual. All of the classes are taught from a foundation of healthy alignment
                with a focus on improving mobility and stability, while developing self-awareness through movement,
                postures and breath. </p>
            <p>
                Yin, Restorative Yoga, Yoga for Backs will be the classes for you. Gentle movements, using props to
                support and nurture you at a slower pace to calm your mind and body. Students can relieve the tension
                and stresses of daily lives as well as working without the pressure of working beyond their comfort
                level. Designed to decrease pain and discomfort of a neglected body or one recovering from injury,
                allowing you to work toward regaining strength and flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                The flow classes continuously move your body integrating strength and flexibility in a non-stop shift
                from posture to posture. The flow classes vary from slower basic movements to progressively more
                advanced. We support slower movements and believe in the healing aspects associated with the ability to
                slow down and stay present. Our teachers encourage a mindful state to practice from, which supports
                healing physically, emotionally and spiritually.
